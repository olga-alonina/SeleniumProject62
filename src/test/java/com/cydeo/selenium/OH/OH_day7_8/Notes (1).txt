- WebTables

		table row  -- tr 
		table data -- td

        Tables are made of <thead> and <tbody>

        	<thead> --> this is the table header, here we have table column names
        		<tr> table row, indicates one whole row
        			<th> --> this tag indicates a cell that is used for table headers

        	<tbody> this is where the data is
        		<tr> table row, indicates one whole row
        			<td> --> cell in a table body


- Windows and Tabs

    - In selenium there is no difference between tabs and windows.
    - Selenium can focus & control one window at a time
    - When we open the page first time it points that page only.
    - When we open a new tab/window, it will still be looking at the old window.
    - To do any interaction with the new window we have to switch to new window.

   How ?

   - Window Handle

		- A randomly generated unique alpha-numeric string that assigned to the tab or window when it's open for the first time.

			For example : CDwindow-289A5E491DD3D41196B5372DFF19885F

		- Every tab and window get their own unique handle value like above.
		- Selenium can use it to switch to certain tab or window.

    - driver.switchTo().window(handle);

    	driver.getWindowHandle() --> returns the handle of the current windows

    	driver.getWindowHandles()--> returns the set of the all open windows.



 - Properties File 
 
 	Properties file works like a control center, we can manage our browser, urls, database and couple of user information from those those file and it changes values everywhere that we used configuration input.
	It has key and  value structure.

		- We need ConfigurationReader class to read data from configuration.properties file
