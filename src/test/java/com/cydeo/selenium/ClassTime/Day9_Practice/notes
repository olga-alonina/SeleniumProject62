Test NG is unit testing framework
    - test are independent, run from top to button bu alphabetical order
    - we could change it with priority

   *********** from parent to child*************
    //tagname[@attribute='value']/child

    *********from child to parent**********
    //tagname[@attribute='value']/..     ->will go to the parent of this webElement
    How to handle dynamic WebElements
   ******** first way:*************
    locate static parent or child(it will not change, so you could rely on it)
   ********* Second way************
    contains, start with, ends with

    //tagname[contains(@atribute,'value')]
    //tagname[ends with(@atribute,'value)]
    //tagname[start With(@atribute,'value)]

  *******  how to use index in locators******
    after search if we receive more that 1 result:
   - if they siblings     ->//table[2]
   - if they not          ->(//table)[2]
